# Manual Hyperparameter Search Report  

Explores the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of a neural network trained for **CIFAR-10 image classification**. The analysis includes visualizations and interpretations of the results.  

## Experiments  

### 1. Learning Rate  
- Impact of different learning rates on training dynamics and final accuracy.  

### 2. Activation Functions  
- Comparison of five (5) activation functions : ReLu, GeLu, Tanh, Sigmoid and LeakyReLU, based on final accuracy.  

### 3. Number of Hidden Units  
- Effect of varying hidden layer sizes on final model performance.  

## Contents  
- **Notebook**: Code for training and evaluating different hyperparameters.  
- **Report (PDF)**: Detailed analysis.
